 <h3>Hoi, hi, bom dia and Kia ora :vulcan_salute:<br>
 So good to see you </h2> 
 
<p>I have been teaching computer science for 20 years and absolutely love it. I have always felt I was missing something by not having experience in the private sector. Having been told #nevertooold, I am working my way towards an interesting opportunity.
</p>
<p>Who knows, next time I am a Software engineer.</p>

:gear: I'm interested in front-end and Cloud <br>
:space_invader: Currently thinkering on AWS and Azure <br>
:crossed_swords: Massive RPG fan<br>
(and dreaming of being a :whale: rider)
